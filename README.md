# .NET MAUI Blazor Hybrid + Tailwind CSS v4 Template

## What this is

A starter template that wires together .NET 9 MAUI Blazor Hybrid, an ASP.NET Core web host, and Tailwind CSS v4 — all in a single solution. The shared Razor component library (`MauiBlazorTailwind.Shared`) runs across every target: Android, iOS, macOS, Windows, and browser. Tailwind is integrated without Node.js, npm, or any build pipeline outside of Visual Studio.

## Why it exists

Getting MAUI Blazor Hybrid and Tailwind CSS working together from scratch is annoying. The official MAUI Blazor templates don't include Tailwind, and most Tailwind guides assume a Node.js-based setup that doesn't fit neatly into a .NET mobile project. This template skips all of that. Clone it, open the solution, and Tailwind is already wired up and working.

## Project structure

```
MauiBlazorTailwind.sln
├── MauiBlazorTailwind/               # .NET MAUI app — handles native shell, platforms, app entry point
├── MauiBlazorTailwind.Shared/        # Shared Razor class library — all pages, layouts, and Tailwind CSS live here
├── MauiBlazorTailwind.Web/           # ASP.NET Core host — serves the Blazor app in a browser
└── MauiBlazorTailwind.Web.Client/    # Blazor WebAssembly client project (paired with MauiBlazorTailwind.Web)
```

`MauiBlazorTailwind.Shared` is the core of the template. Everything you build goes here and runs on all targets without duplication.

## Prerequisites

- [.NET 9 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/9.0)
- [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) (17.8 or later) with the MAUI workload installed
- [Tailwind CSS VS2022 Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TheronWang.TailwindCSSIntellisense) by Theron Wang

## Getting started

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd MAUI-Template-With-Tailwind
```

Open `MauiBlazorTailwind.sln` in Visual Studio 2022. Set your startup project to `MauiBlazorTailwind` for native targets or `MauiBlazorTailwind.Web` for the browser. Hit run.

No `dotnet restore` step needed beyond what Visual Studio handles automatically.

## How Tailwind works in this setup

The Tailwind CSS VS2022 extension by Theron Wang handles CSS generation entirely inside Visual Studio — no Node.js, no npm, no CLI.

- **Input file:** `MauiBlazorTailwind.Shared/wwwroot/Tailwind/input.css`
- **Output file:** `MauiBlazorTailwind.Shared/wwwroot/Tailwind/output.css` (generated by the extension)
- **Extension config:** `MauiBlazorTailwind/tailwind.extension.json` — tells the extension where the input and output files are
- **Referenced in layout:** `MauiBlazorTailwind.Shared/Layout/MainLayout.razor` links `output.css` so all pages pick it up

When you edit a Razor file in Visual Studio, the extension watches for Tailwind class usage and regenerates `output.css` automatically.

## Notes

- `output.css` is committed to the repo so the project builds without requiring the extension. If you're contributing without VS2022, the CSS is still there.
- The extension uses Tailwind v4 via `@import "tailwindcss"` in `input.css`. There is no `tailwind.config.js` — v4 handles configuration through CSS-first directives.
- Tizen is included in the MAUI platform targets by default (.NET template artifact) but is not a supported target for this template.
- The solution targets Android, iOS, macOS (Mac Catalyst), and Windows.
